# hardware-trigger-time-sync-lidar-cameras
This repository contains the schematic design and PCB designs for two hardware-trigger circuits, designed using open-source software KiCAD. It also contains the arduino code used to obtain required time-delays.

Two folders are available:
1. lidar_and_three_cameras  (This contains design and code files for lidar with three camera - tested for roadside multi-sensor setup)
   -- kicad_files
   -- arduino_nano_files
2. lidar_and_seven_cameras (This contains design and code files for lidar with seven camera - designed for multi-sensor car)
   -- kicad_files
   -- arduino_nano_files
